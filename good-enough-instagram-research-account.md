# Create Instagram research accounts

## Step 1 Preconsiderations

It is recommendable to create at least 2â€“3 research accounts in advance because they might get blocked in the process. Populate these accounts with some activities, by posting images and starting to follow some other users. In this way they seem more authentic for Instagram. 

In terms of retrieving data, it is recommendable to have separate scraping accounts (repurposed in conjunction with the tool/script) accounts that are targets of scraping (accounts for which the followers are purchased) 

You can create five different Instagram accounts from one IP address/phone number


## Step 2

Creating an Instagram account requires research 
* email account 
* phone number for validation

If you encounter problems in creating Instagram account (e.g. code validation problem) you can try to create an account with another browser, in incognito mode or buy a new prepaid SIM-card
